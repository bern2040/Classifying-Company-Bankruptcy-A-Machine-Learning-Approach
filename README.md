# Classifying-Company-Bankruptcy-A-Machine-Learning-Approach

The main goal of this project is to be able to correctly classify companies as bankrupt or not based upon key financial attributes. This is valuable to allow investors to make informed decisions about money investments and companies to understand what financial metrics may lead to bankruptcy to address concerns before they may become detrimental. In order to do this, data has been fitted to multiple models to optimize classification accuracy and minimize errors that prove the most risk in incorrect classification. After conducting exploratory analysis of our data, we used k-means clustering to understand how observations could be grouped based upon financial metric similarities, disregarding their classification of bankruptcy or not. Next, we began to fit our data to multiple models: logistic regression full model, logistic regression reduced model using BH procedure, logistic regression using lasso cross validation, decision tree, random forest, and random forest with an adjusted threshold. Out of sample metrics were calculated for each model to identify the model with the best performance and minimal amounts of costly risks.
